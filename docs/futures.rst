Futures
########

Futures represent the outcome of asynchronous operations. They provide a way to handle long-running tasks without blocking the main execution thread. Futures allow you to submit events for execution and then either wait for their completion or continue with other tasks, checking back later for results. This enables efficient, non-blocking execution of complex workflows.
