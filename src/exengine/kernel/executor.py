        Submit one or more acquisition events for execution.

        This method handles the submission of acquisition events to be executed on active threads. It provides
        options for event prioritization, thread allocation, and performance optimization.

        Execution Behavior:
        - By default, all events are executed on a single thread in submission order to prevent concurrency issues.
        - Events can be parallelized across different threads using the 'use_free_thread' parameter.
        - Priority execution can be requested using the 'prioritize' parameter.

        Parameters:
        ----------
        event_or_events : Union[ExecutorEvent, Iterable[ExecutorEvent]]
            A single ExecutorEvent or an iterable of ExecutorEvents to be submitted.

        transpile : bool, optional (default=True)
            If True and multiple events are submitted, attempt to optimize them for better performance.
            This may result in events being combined or reorganized.

        prioritize : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, execute the event(s) before any others in the queue on its assigned thread.
            Useful for system-wide changes affecting other events, like hardware adjustments.

        use_free_thread : bool, optional (default=False)
            If True, execute the event(s) on an available thread with an empty queue, creating a execution_engine one if necessary.
            Useful for operations like cancelling or stopping events awaiting signals.
            If False, execute on the primary thread.

        data_handler : DataHandler, optional (default=None)
            Object to handle data and metadata produced by DataProducingExecutorEvents.

        Returns:
        -------
        Union[AcquisitionFuture, Iterable[AcquisitionFuture]]
            For a single event: returns a single AcquisitionFuture.
            For multiple events: returns an Iterable of AcquisitionFutures.
            Note: The number of returned futures may differ from the input if transpilation occurs.

        Notes:
        -----
        - Transpilation may optimize multiple events, potentially altering their number or structure.
        - Use 'prioritize' for critical system changes that should occur before other queued events.
        - 'use_free_thread' is essential for operations that need to run independently, like cancellation events.
