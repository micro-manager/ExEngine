    Required base class for all devices usable with the execution engine

    Device classes should inherit from this class and implement the abstract methods. The DeviceMetaclass will wrap all
    methods and attributes in the class to make them thread-safe and to optionally record all method calls and
    attribute accesses.

    Attributes with a trailing _noexec will not be wrapped and will be executed directly on the calling thread. This is
    useful for attributes that are not hardware related and can bypass the complexity of the executor.

    Device implementations can also implement functionality through properties (i.e. attributes that are actually
    methods) by defining a getter and setter method for the property.
