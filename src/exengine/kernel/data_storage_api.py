#         Create one big Dask array with last two axes as y, x and preceding axes depending on data.
#         If the dataset is saved to disk, the dask array is made up of memory-mapped numpy arrays,

#         To convert data into a numpy array, call np.asarray() on the returned result. However, doing so will bring the
